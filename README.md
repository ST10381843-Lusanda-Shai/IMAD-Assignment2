# IMAD-Assignment2

Good evening sir hope you are doing well.

COMPREHENSIVE REPORT

The purpose for my Flashcard application was created to help users study while using flashcards on different topics for subjects they take in school or for general knowledge. With the help of my application they would be able to take a quiz which shows them 5 questions where they will have to show whether the question they received is true or false. As they finish answering their questions they will be given a score to showcase the user on how well they did on the quiz and they will make way their way to the review screen where they will be able to review the question and the correct answers to those questions. I hope this application will help users get better at their studies to achieve the dreams they are pursuing. Github is the version control and collaboration of Git and Github actions is where coders an programmers can check for errors in their code and automate their development workflows such as building, testing and deploying their code.

6. The reason I used ChatGPT was because I couldnâ€™t find any resources that would help me build the review screen functions to help show the questions and answers to those questions. I used the AI today late at midnight at 2am. There is the second part of the 3rd screenshot that is missing since the website was accidently refreshed.
